State Localize
================

Based on [Dynamic Select Menus](http://railscasts.com/episodes/88-dynamic-select-menus-revised?view=asciicast) on [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com).  

Localize state(prefecture) with [Globalize](https://github.com/globalize/globalize).  
This app localizes only Japanese state(prefecture).  
But you can add state localizations of other countries by adding the records to state_translations table.
